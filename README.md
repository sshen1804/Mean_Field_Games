# Mean Field Games With Congestion Effects
The theory of mean field games (MFGs in short), has been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry
and P-L. Lions, and aims at studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria)
as the number of players tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational players are indistinguishable and
individually have a negligible influence on the game, and that each individual strategy is influenced by some
averages of quantities depending on the states (or the controls) of the other players. The applications of
MFGs are numerous, from economics and finance to the study of crowd motion. On the other hand, very
few MFG problems have explicit or semi-explicit solutions. Therefore, numerical simulations of MFGs play
a crucial role in obtaining quantitative information from this class of models.
